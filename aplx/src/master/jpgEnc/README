=============== This is the master part for encoder - mSpinJPEG ================
How does it work?
- It works in conjuction with mSpinJPEGdec
- For testing purpose: 
  - mSpinJPEGdec receives raw image (grayscale 1 channel) from host-PC via SDP
  - mSPinJPEGdec allocate sdram buffer for that raw image
  - once complete, the mSpinJPEGdec send FR packet to mSpinJPEGenc, which contains
    the address of that sdram buffer
  - when receiving the FR packet, mSpinJPEGenc starts the encoding
  - once finish, the mSpinJPEGenc send the result to host-PC

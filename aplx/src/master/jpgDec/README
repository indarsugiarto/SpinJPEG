=============== This is the master part for decoder - mSpinJPEG ================
How does it work?
- spinjpeg needs to know, how big is the buffer in sdram
  --> GUI sends initial info via port-2 the size of file, and wait ack from spinjpeg
  --> spinjpeg resize sdram buffer and send ack afterwards
- we can, conceptually, use leadAp to create a dynamic core selection
  --> but the GUI will ask first, who is the leader to send the data
  --> so, let's simplify by deciding that the leader is core-2, and after
      core-2 are workers

in hDMA:
/* when the first chunk of jpeg file is received, it triggers
 * the decoder main loop */
